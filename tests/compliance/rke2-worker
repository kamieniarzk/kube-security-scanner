== Remediations policies ==
5.1.1 Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and
if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges.
Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the
clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role :
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]

5.1.2 Where possible, remove get, list and watch access to Secret objects in the cluster.

5.1.3 Where possible replace any use of wildcards in clusterroles and roles with specific
objects or actions.

5.1.4 Where possible, remove create access to pod objects in the cluster.

5.1.5 Create explicit service accounts wherever a Kubernetes workload requires specific access
to the Kubernetes API server.
Modify the configuration of each default service account to include this value
automountServiceAccountToken: false

5.1.6 Modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service
account tokens to disable it.

5.1.7 Remove the system:masters group from all users in the cluster.

5.1.8 Where possible, remove the impersonate, bind and escalate rights from subjects.

5.1.9 Where possible, remove create access to PersistentVolume objects in the cluster.

5.1.10 Where possible, remove access to the proxy sub-resource of node objects.

5.1.11 Where possible, remove access to the approval sub-resource of certificatesigningrequest objects.

5.1.12 Where possible, remove access to the validatingwebhookconfigurations or mutatingwebhookconfigurations objects

5.1.13 Where possible, remove access to the token sub-resource of serviceaccount objects.

5.2.1 Ensure that either Pod Security Admission or an external policy control system is in place
for every namespace which contains user workloads.

5.2.2 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of privileged containers.

5.2.3 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of `hostPID` containers.

5.2.4 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of `hostIPC` containers.

5.2.5 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of `hostNetwork` containers.

5.2.6 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of containers with `.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `true`.

5.2.7 Create a policy for each namespace in the cluster, ensuring that either `MustRunAsNonRoot`
or `MustRunAs` with the range of UIDs not including 0, is set.

5.2.8 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of containers with the `NET_RAW` capability.

5.2.9 Ensure that `allowedCapabilities` is not present in policies for the cluster unless
it is set to an empty array.

5.2.10 Review the use of capabilites in applications running on your cluster. Where a namespace
contains applicaions which do not require any Linux capabities to operate consider adding
a PSP which forbids the admission of containers which do not drop all capabilities.

5.2.11 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of containers that have `.securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess` set to `true`.

5.2.12 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of containers with `hostPath` volumes.

5.2.13 Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the
admission of containers which use `hostPort` sections.

5.3.1 If the CNI plugin in use does not support network policies, consideration should be given to
making use of a different plugin, or finding an alternate mechanism for restricting traffic
in the Kubernetes cluster.

5.3.2 Follow the documentation and create NetworkPolicy objects as you need them.

5.4.1 If possible, rewrite application code to read Secrets from mounted secret files, rather than
from environment variables.

5.4.2 Refer to the Secrets management options offered by your cloud provider or a third-party
secrets management solution.

5.5.1 Follow the Kubernetes documentation and setup image provenance.

5.7.1 Follow the documentation and create namespaces for objects in your deployment as you need
them.

5.7.2 Use `securityContext` to enable the docker/default seccomp profile in your pod definitions.
An example is as below:
  securityContext:
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault

5.7.3 Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply SecurityContexts to your Pods. For a
suggested list of SecurityContexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark for Docker
Containers.

5.7.4 Ensure that namespaces are created to allow for appropriate segregation of Kubernetes
resources and that all new resources are created in a specific namespace.
